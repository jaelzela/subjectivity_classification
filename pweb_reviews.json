In my opinion, their decision to limit their APIs to only their 'premium' customers is supremely stupid and is the type of shortsightedness that can only come from a company with a \"Sales\" culture where they are always looking to close bigger deals as opposed to a \"Marketing\" culture where they are always looking to grow the value of their platform and meet the needs of their customers. I plan to blog about this at my Salesforce blog, and any help making my point that it would be in Salesforce's best interest to offer their API to all customers would be greatly appreciated.",
