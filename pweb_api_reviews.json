The default output is JSON. This output format was chosen due to the availability of JSON parsers in many languages. The Yelp v2.0 API enables access to more relevant search results that more closely match the results on Yelp. It uses a standard and secure authorization protocol (OAuth 1.0a, xAuth).",

Catalog API provides access to the Shopzilla, Inc. inventory of catalogued products, merchant offers, and merchant ratings & reviews content through a query-based RESTful web service, responses formatted in XML or JSON|P. Managed through the Shopzilla Publisher Program, a CPC affiliate marketing program, publishers are able to monetize using this API. Users of this API are able to choose between two versions, each providing logic native to its corresponding Shopzilla, Inc. property: Bizrate.com or Beso.com. Bizrate API: Provides access to the entire Shopzilla, Inc. offer universe, exposing content from 8,000+ merchants. You would use this version to create a full comparison shopping site. Beso API: Provides the opportunity to create a style-based experience with a curated set of offers focused in soft goods categories. You would use this version to create a fashion-oriented shopping site. Both APIs provide access to the merchant ratings and reviews collected through the Bizrate Insights platform. International? APIs also available for the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.",

It provides access to search the connection and play or download recordings and to submit new recordings. Discussion forums encourage interactions among members of the birding community to exchange information about bird song and related topics. API methods support search against the database by specifying the formal Latin name of a bird species. Returned data provide listings of all recordings maintained by the service for that species, either with or without URLs for audio and still image files, or optionally a request can retrieve a single representative recording. Methods also provide summary statistics about listings relevant to the species named in the request.",

Earn commission or revenue share through utilising this API which on Business Meetings alone allows you to serve the \u00c2\u00a3125bn market. Spanning 1200 business centres, 550 cities and 95 countries, the Regus API, supporting both SOAP and REST protocols, allows developers to access the Regus central inventory system. With this access, you can take advantage of functionality such as searching, checking availability, pricing, making a booking, and making amendments and cancellations. This API offers online booking directly into the global inventory system. In a market that is still largely booked by voice online booking is a huge efficiency advantage. Industry research shows that on average each voice booking takes 11 minutes and typically the venue has to make manual diary checks and will not come back with a response until 1 hour 51 minutes later. By contrast, the API allows you to search, book and pay in a simple three step process - just a matter of seconds.

Client programs can use the API to login, get data, and post changes. The API supports thin web-based JavaScript clients, such as Navigation popups or LiveRC, end-user applications (such as vandal fighter), and can be accessed by another web site (tool server's utilities).

The theme was geared toward local businesses and was presented by American Express OPEN Forum, which I feel necessary to mention now has an API of their own allowing instant access to small business content.

In the time since the Netflix API was released, the business has shifted to streaming instant video, from hundreds of devices. Meanwhile, the Netflix API hasn't changed much and it's time for a redesign, according to Netflix's Daniel Jacobson in his talk at OSCon Wednesday. Jacobson's talk offers examples of how the next iteration might look, including doing away with versions, but creating unique endpoints for each partner's application.",

The Pinterest API provides developers access to an authenticated user's pinboards and pins. The API provides detailed user data, as well as the home feed for a user, pins, likes, following, followers and the ability to unfollow. Developers can also access information about specific boards and pins, including creating boards, adding pins, categories and adding/removing likes. The API allows businesses to integrate with Pinterest's social media platform in an effort engage with customers. With the APIs, developers can access a site's top repins, most recent pins, related pins, most clicked through pins and pins resulting from specific search terms. The API makes its data available via JSON only, with requests also wrapped as JSON. Though the official documentation has been removed, we've included a cache of the page, as the API still appears to be supported.",

In my opinion, their decision to limit their APIs to only their 'premium' customers is supremely stupid and is the type of shortsightedness that can only come from a company with a \"Sales\" culture where they are always looking to close bigger deals as opposed to a \"Marketing\" culture where they are always looking to grow the value of their platform and meet the needs of their customers. I plan to blog about this at my Salesforce blog, and any help making my point that it would be in Salesforce's best interest to offer their API to all customers would be greatly appreciated.",

        "description": "Salesforce.com API provides programmatic access to an organization\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds information and allows developers to implement custom functionality. The worldwide leader in on-demand customer relationship management (CRM) services. More companies trust their vital customer and sales data to salesforce.com than any other on-demand CRM company in the world. The Apex platform and API extends Salesforce and the AppExchange is a directory of on-demand applications. The Force.com web services API allows users to create, retrieve, update or delete records, such as accounts, leads, and custom objects. With more than 20 different calls, the API also allows users to maintain passwords, perform searches, and much more. The REST-based Bulk API is optimized for loading or deleting large sets of data. It allows users to query, insert, update, upsert, or delete a large number of records asynchronously by submitting a number of batches which are processed in the background by Salesforce.com. The SOAP-based API, is optimized for real-time client applications that update small numbers of records at a time. Although the SOAP-based API can also be used for processing large numbers of records, when the data sets contain hundreds of thousands of records it becomes less practical. The Bulk API is designed to make it simple to process data from a few thousand to millions of records. The Metadata API can be used to retrieve, deploy, create, update or delete customization information, such as custom object definitions and page layouts, for an organization using Salesforce.com. The Metadata API is intended for managing customizations and for building tools that can manage the metadata model, not the data itself.",

When you upload a video to Revver, it attaches an ad and its unique tracking technology to \"Revverize\" the video. Any ad revenue generated by the video is split 50/50 between the creator and Revver. Revver API allows you to build your own video sharing sites. It is well suited for applications that use heavy javascript or AJAX, and/or Flash, but not appropriate for applications that need to update or add content to Revver. For those functions, you will need to use XML-RPC for security reasons. Programmatically view the Revver library. Distribute Revver videos or push users to the Revver videos, and then monetize this for yourself. Syndication and social aspects available.",

It does so by combing a users security keys into one big, encrypted \"blob.\" Apparently this information is more secure than normal user authentication practices and is callable via the OneID API. Once a users information is in the blob, OneID authenticates a user when they are trying to log into a site by confirming three different digital signatures on different devices.

In this post, we will toss those six into the spotlight, which include the Internet DJ API. The Internet DJ API allows developers to access and integrate the functionality of the Internet DJ site into their application. The functionality allows for access to site news, forum, music and new release, mixes, song of the day, and data about pretty much everything the site has to offer. API requests are limited to 5,000 a day and responses are formatted in JSON.",

Panoramio is a community-powered site for exploring places through photography: cities, natural wonders, or anywhere you might go.

        "description": "OpenStreetMap is the free wiki world map, an open volunteer-driven initiative to collaboratively create a map of the world, and release the map data under a free and open license. There are actually many different APIs in and around the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as http://leafletjs.com These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option) Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from http://planet.openstreetmap.org and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data. We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for! You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app. Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun! If you need help with development, join the osm-dev mailing list, or other OpenStreetMap contact channels: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact",

This API features two concepts, campground and campsite. Campgrounds are generally situated inside state or national parks and consist of one or more campsites. The Active.com Campgrounds API is a read-only API and returns registration links for campgrounds on ReserveAmerica.com which is public data. As a result, no security measures (SSL, Oauth) are required. The API uses RESTful calls and responses are formatted in XML.

Based on this feedback, Facebook reversed its decision and neither phone or address is returned to applications at this time. Privacy is a big concern, especially for APIs, but Facebook took appropriate steps for gaining user permission.

EC2 users can send 2,000 emails per day for free. The service allows developers to send either raw email or formatted email using Amazon's SMTP servers. Any spam complaints or other issues bubble back up to the developer. Similar to other Amazon Web Services, Amazon SES charges per gigabyte for transfer in and out of its systems.",

Google Calendar allows client applications to view and update calendar events in the form of Google data API, GData, feeds. The Calendar Data API lets users incorporate Calendar functionality into their own application or website. Users can edit calendars, create and delete events, query for events that match particular criteria, send invitations, and more. There are many possible uses for the Calendar data API. For example, users can create a web front end for a group calendar that uses Google Calendar as a back end. Or a public calendar can be generated for Google Calendar to display, based on a company event database. Or users can search relevant calendars to display a list of upcoming events on those calendars.",

In fact, some of the earliest APIs are based on Electronic Data Interchange, which dates back to the 1960s. Granted many of these connections are highly complex enterprise only integrations, it is a history that should bode well for modern day integrations, should it not? Despite a long history of interconnectedness, much of the travel space still remains behind closed doors.  The major global distribution systems, represented by Sabre, Travelport, and Amadeus all offer powerful APIs of their own, but their commercial requirements tend to be out of the league of most application developers. In spite of the limitations the travel industry has effectively self imposed, there still exists many opportunities to monetize sites using travel APIs. There are several types of APIs available in the travel space. Most are transactional and some are content driven.  Let's take a look a broad categorization of available travel APIs.",

        "description": "eBay's primary web services are found in the three following API's: The [[http://www.programmableweb.com/api/ebay-trading Trading API]] is designed to provide robust support for transactional activities. The services offered by the Trading API allow developers to list items, manage user information, get item information, and manage eBay sales and purchases. The [[http://www.programmableweb.com/api/ebay-shopping Shopping API]] is a more lightweight service that is optimized for buyer shopping and browsing. The Shopping API lets users take searches off of eBay and put them into their own site or application. This API is designed for the creation of buying applications with very fast response times. The [[http://www.programmableweb.com/api/ebay-finding Finding API]] is eBay's next generation search API. The Finding API provides more relevant search results compared to existing search API's and has an array of search refinement capabilities. Developers can leverage the Finding API to integrate more robust searching and browsing experiences into their buying applications. Note: As of October 2011, eBay has deprecated the GetSearchResults and GetCategoryListings services from the Trading API, and the FindItemsAdvanced and FindItems services from the Shopping API. This functionality has been migrated to the Finding API.",

On del.icio.us, you can use tags to organize and remember your bookmarks, which is a much more flexible system than folders.

When Facebook suffered a bad day, the top twenty news sites experienced load times of 12.5 seconds (compared to the usual 5-7 seconds). Top retail sites load times slowed to 5.7 seconds from the typical 2.2. seconds. All of this dragging because of a poorly performing \"Like\" button at a Facebook data center?

The Google AdWords API lets developers build applications that interact directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications, advertisers and third parties can more efficiently and creatively manage their large or complex AdWords accounts and campaigns. With the API, developers can automatically generate keywords, ad text, and destination URLs, integrate AdWords data with an inventory system to manage campaigns based on stock and develop additional tools and applications to help you manage accounts. The AdWords API SOAP interface is supported by all popular programming languages, including Java, PHP, Python, .NET, Perl, and Ruby.",

When Facebook suffered a bad day, the top twenty news sites experienced load times of 12.5 seconds (compared to the usual 5-7 seconds). Top retail sites load times slowed to 5.7 seconds from the typical 2.2. seconds. All of this dragging because of a poorly performing \"Like\" button at a Facebook data center? This could have much larger implications for companies that are inherently reliant on data from external sources (e.g. websites pulling third-party data via APIs).",

        "description": "Weather Underground provides real-time weather information via the Internet. Weather Underground provides weather reports for cities across the world as well as local weather reports for newspapers and Web sites. The Weather Underground API allows developers and users to access data from Weather Underground to integrate the data and functionality into other applications. They offer a variety of plans and pricing, though most use is free. Some example API methods include accessing weather information by cities and regions, retrieving forecast information, accessing satellite images, and current conditions by location. A unique feature of this API is the Developer Dashboard. Developers have great insight into usage and errors in real time. Over 80 languages are supported with this API. Finally, the folks at Weather Underground have come up with a cleaver way to allow for rate limit overages via a tool called Raindrops. This gives developers a cushion to avoid denial of service errors due to spikes in API requests.",

        "description": "LinkedIn is the worlds largest business social networking hub. Launched in 2003, LinkedIn has millions of users and is implemented in over 200 countries. One purpose of the site is to allow registered users to maintain a list of contact details of people with whom they have some level of relationship, called Connections. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn actually provides 2 APIs: -The JavaScript API is a rich client library enabling you to build dynamic applications in the web browser. Use OAuth 2 to easily authorize users via the \"Sign In with LinkedIn\" button, access LinkedIn data with native objects, and interact with Plugins. -The REST API provides a simple, consistent representation of people, companies, jobs, and the interactions and relationships between them. Our query language lets you read data in XML and JSON at the granularity and aggregation that you choose. Use OAuth 1.0a to authorize users and begin making REST API calls using any programming language.",

RescueGroups.org provides three adoptable pet data APIs: REST - full download of hundreds of thousands of adoptable pets, descriptions and pictures SOAP - live queries with a SOAP API (replaced with the json API below) HTTP/json - live queries with json. The HTTP/json API provides programmatic access to both public and private data objects including animals, contacts, web pages, events, etc. Also, the RescueGroups.org HTTP/json API is the only UPDATEABLE rescue/shelter API available. Our clients and ASPs can build their management systems on top of the RescueGroups.org platform using the updateable API.

        "description": "The WebEx Meeting Services API Platform lets users incorporate Cisco WebEx meetings into their own applications. The platform offers three APIs: URL API: The URL API is a convenient, lightweight, HTTP(S)-based mechanism that provides browser-based, external hooks into WebEx meeting services. The URL API is typically used in enterprise portal integrations to support basic interactions such as Single Sign-On (SSO), scheduling meetings, starting and joining simple meetings, and inviting attendees and presenters. XML API: The XML API is a comprehensive set of services that supports most aspects of WebEx meeting services, including detailed user management, comprehensive scheduling features, attendee management and reporting, and more. The WebEx XML API employs a services oriented architecture (SOA) to provide comprehensive services to external applications wishing to interact with one or more WebEx services. Teleconference Service Provider (TSP) API: The TSP API provides full-featured XML-based integration with audio conferencing networks. The integration architecture supports redundancy, fail-over, and load balancing, and provides robust features that tightly integrate audio conferencing capabilities with telephony management and provisioning in the WebEx environment.",
